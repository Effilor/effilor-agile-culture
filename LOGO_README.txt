# LOGO FILE REQUIRED

You need to add the Effilor logo file to this directory.

**Required:**
- File name: `effilor-logo.jpg`
- Format: JPG
- Recommended size: ~180KB
- Dimensions: Width should be ~1200-1500px (will auto-scale in assessment)

**Location:**
Place this file in the root directory, at the same level as `index.html`.

**Where to get it:**
Use your existing Effilor logo file from previous assessments (Growth Mindset, Strategic Thinking Quotient, etc.)

**After adding the logo:**
1. Commit the file to your GitHub repository
2. Vercel will automatically redeploy
3. Test that the logo displays correctly on all screens

If you need to use a different logo filename, update these references in `index.html`:
- Line ~11: `const LOGO_URL = "./effilor-logo.jpg";`

Change to match your actual filename.
